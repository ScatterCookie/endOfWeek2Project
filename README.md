# endOfWeek2Project

This was a tough one, really showed me, or rather made me remember how much a small error can ruin your code.
So i didn't attempt all of the challenges this week as some of them felt a little out of my scope, but the ones I looked into like using keys to navigate I managed with relative ease.
the task itself was a long shot away from last week and looking into it all it was a challenge but one I had fun with
